## Introduction

Now it's possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [NikeFuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or [Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement, a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health or to find patterns in their behavior. Unfurtunatelly, these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

Usually, people quantify the amount of exercise they do but don't the quality of it. The objective of this project is to use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell to classify when an exercise is done correctly or not.

## Files in the Directory
In this directory you can find the next files:
1. `Workout Classification.py`: This is a jupyter notebook with all the data analysis and ML models.
2. `functions.py`: Its contains utilities functions used in the data analysis.
3. Some images that help to illustrate and embellish the notebook.

## Packages
Only basic Python packages were used (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`).
